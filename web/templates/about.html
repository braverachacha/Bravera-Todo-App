      <p>
        Bravera Journal is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help users record their
        daily thoughts, tasks, and reflections effortlessly. The goal of this project is to encourage
        consistency, self-awareness, and productivity through journaling.

        Built with <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, this app provides users with a clean interface to

        ensuring privacy and personalization.
